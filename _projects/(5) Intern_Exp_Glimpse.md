# Gary the medical assistance robot
<br>
### Brief overview
<br>
As a Robotics Software Intern at Unlimited Robotics, I contributed to various aspects of the development and deployment of Gary, a multifunctional service robot designed for healthcare environments. My work involved configuring navigation frameworks, implementing obstacle avoidance algorithms, and developing protocols for autonomous elevator usage. I gained valuable experience in integrating robotics software stacks and performing real-time testing and optimization in a challenging environment. Additionally, I worked on enhancing system performance by utilizing debugging techniques, optimizing navigation modules, and ensuring seamless communication between the robot and hospital systems.

My time as an intern provided me with hands-on experience in applying robotics concepts such as sensor fusion, localization, path planning, and multi-floor navigation.

### Hardware
* Gary: A multifunctional robot equipped with two robotic arms featuring 7 degrees of freedom, Intel RealSense depth cameras, LiDAR sensors, and IMUs for robust perception and navigation.

* Control Hardware: Arduino-based microcontrollers for handling servo motors and various I/O operations.

* Sensors: 3 Intel RealSense depth cameras, LiDAR, and IMU sensors for environmental perception and obstacle detection.

* Power Supply: 5V power source for motors, integrated with control systems.


### Software

ROS2: Utilized for implementing the navigation stack, obstacle avoidance, and 3D localization.

RViz2: Used for visualization of sensor data, pose estimation, and map alignment.

Ra-Ya SDK: Employed for developing custom applications and interfacing Gary with external systems.

Python3 & Shell Scripting: For coding and deploying various modules within the ROS2 framework.

Networking: Ethernet PoE switch for communication and remote access through RESTful APIs.

Gazebo Simulation: Testing and optimizing the robot’s navigation stack before real-world deployme

**Responsibilities Held:**
<br>
During my internship, I played a critical role in robot fleet management, elevator integration, ground operations, and robotic arm debugging and coding. This involved:

Robot Fleet Management and Navigation:
I connected Gary to the hospital’s fleet management system using the Orchestra software, ensuring efficient logistics management. My responsibilities included implementing obstacle avoidance and path planning algorithms using 2D mapping and 3D localization. I continuously tested and fine-tuned navigation algorithms to ensure reliable operation in complex hospital environments.

Elevator Integration:
I developed and tested protocols for autonomous elevator usage, allowing Gary to reach various floors without manual intervention. This involved designing and implementing APIs for communication between Gary and the elevator control systems, ensuring seamless vertical transitions and multi-floor accessibility.

Ground Operations:
I supported Gary in its primary task of delivering medications and supplies by securely attaching carts and coordinating delivery routes to healthcare professionals. I also verified the robot’s performance through real-time monitoring, system logs analysis, and debugging.I connected Gary to the hospital’s fleet management system using the Orchestra software, ensuring efficient logistics management. This process required me to implement sophisticated path planning algorithms and obstacle avoidance techniques using SLAM-based 2D mapping and 3D localization. 


System Configuration and Deployment:
I regularly configured and activated the navigation stack to facilitate 2D mapping and 3D localization. This process involved launching ROS2 nodes and monitoring their status through Google Chrome-based server tools, ensuring proper communication between various subsystems.

Robotic Arm Debugging and Coding:
I extensively worked with the robotic arms attached to Gary, which feature 7 degrees of freedom. My tasks included debugging the arm's movements, implementing software modules for controlling gripper mechanisms, and ensuring precise manipulation capabilities. I have also worked in optimizing arm motion profiles for tasks such as object grasping, transportation, and delivery within the hospital environment.
