# **About Me**
<br>
<font size="+1">
Hi, I am <b>Ravi Teja Kolli</b> :wave:.<br>

<br>
A robotics engineer with a passion for solving complex challenges using cutting-edge technology.
<br>

<br>
I am a graduate with a Master's degree in Robotics and Automation from the University of Delaware. I also hold a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering and Technology Management from Chalmers University, Sweden and a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, India . My studies have included significant coursework in Robotic Manipulation, Machine learning, embedded systems,robot sensing and navigation. As an engineer, I enjoy working on challenging projects that combine multiple disciplines, from mechanical design and control systems to software development.
<br>
    
<br>
During my internship, I have worked with Unlimited Robotics on autonomous health care robot, with Python, ROS2 and employing debugging techniques such as Gazebo simulation testing, fault injection, and performance analysis via ROS2 tracing to optimize autonomous navigation. I was also involved in developing robust communication interfaces using gRPC, ensuring real-time data exchange and compatibility between robots and hospital fleet management. We have also worked effectively in integrating Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)-based localization and devised a multi-floor elevator access system, enabling seamless vertical transitions with tuned motion profiles. I collaborated with the assembly/design team to assemble the autonomous robot sensor mounting platforms and for data collection.
<br>
  
<br>
My skills include programming in Python, C++, C, Bash, and Assembly Language. In robotics, I have experience with ROS2/(ROS), Gazebo, MoveIt, Machine Learning, OpenCV, SLAM, Computer Vision, Control systems design, and Embedded systems. My technical skills span across PLC programming with Allen Bradley controllers, and Ladder logic programming. With 3 years of experience in automation engineering at Pragati Offset Pvt.Ltd and SIA Automation and also as a Robotic Process Automation developer (RPA), I bring a strong foundation in programming, optimization, and troubleshooting. I am also proficient in Linux, Git, CMake, Unit Testing, Ardupilot, and MATLAB software.
